                    <h2>Doug Beatty</h2>
                    <p>Founder and owner of Doug Beatty and Son's. Doug started in the wood heating business working for Tom Dooley part-time and eventually full-time processing firewood. Once his family arrived he started doing it himself full time and after constantly being asked if he swept chimneys, and him being a bit of a monkey himself he decided to begin offering sweeping services and that eventually led the business into the rest of the home heating industry.</p>

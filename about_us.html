                <h2>Field Team</h2>
                <p><strong>Doug Beatty:</strong> Founder and owner of Doug Beatty and Son's Doug started in the wood heating business working for Tom Dooley part time and eventually full time processing firewood. Once his family arrived he started doing it himself full time and after constantly being asked if he swept chimneys, and him being a bit of a monkey himself he decided to begin offering sweeping services and that eventually led the business into the rest of the home heating industry.</p>

                <p><strong>Thomas Beatty:</strong> With the business always being family oriented and being the oldest of three children it was a natural fit for Thomas to join into Doug Beatty & Sons. During his high school co-op program he worked in the office developing programs to assist the business flow and worked at becoming WETT certified.Following high school he joined his father on the field team.</p>

                <h2>Office Team</h2>
                <p><strong>Cindy Beatty:</strong>Doug's wife, worked in an office setting over the years in different capacities so it was a natural progression for her to become Doug's office support person, and occasionally in the field as a gofer. Over the years her position has expanded from answering the phones, to scheduling, ordering parts, helping prepare quotes and manning the showroom and handling all the paperwork side of the business.</p>
